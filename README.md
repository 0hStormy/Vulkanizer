Replaces OpenGL with <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/vulkanmod">VulkanMod</a> along with adding some other performance and Quality of Life mods. Vulkanizer is meant to be light weight at ~30mb when installed. Vulkanizer also includes a couple Quality of Life mods like  <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/zoomify">Zoomify</a> and <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/dashloader">Dash Loader</a>.

<h2>ðŸ’¾ Installation</h2>
Installing Vulkanizer is pretty easy. You can install it in a couple ways, you can use the <a href="https://modrinth.com/app">Modrinth App</a> or something like <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism Launcher</a>. With the Modrinth app, just search up the modpack, and press install! On Prism Launcher, go to New Instance, click on Modrinth, Search Vulkanizer, and click OK.
